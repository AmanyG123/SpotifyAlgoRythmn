Artists are sometimes recognized by extravagant features on songs even though they may not be the lead in the song. Naturally, some of their best or well known work are in songs they are featured in. We want to give the ability to find the artist's best features. 

First, we retrieved all songs that included the artist of interest, whether as the main artist or as a featured artist of the song. Next, we filtered this collection to derive a list of all songs that the artist of interest was not considered the main singer, rapper, etc. We then implemented a merge sort and quick sort algorithm to sort this new list of songs by popularity from greatest to least.
